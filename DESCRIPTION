Description: The package phrynomics is a toolkit for manipulating SNP data. It
    will read in sequences, check for variable and binary sites, allow removal
    of taxa or sites, and transform characters in various ways. There are
    options for exporting data to fit several popular phylogenetics programs
    (ex: RAxML, MrBayes, and SNAPP).
